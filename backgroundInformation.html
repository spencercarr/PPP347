    <p> (I will edit this and make it not terrible by the end) <br>
        I grew up in an area around Harrisonburg VA close to Reddish Knob. <br>
        My love for technology started young when I first modded my Playstation 3. <br>
        I chose computer science because I was always the best at puzzles among my peers. <br>
        I have a dog and a cat. <br>
        I like swimming, riding dirt bikes, jumping on trampolines, and doing nothing for extended periods of time. <br>
        This summer I worked an internship as a Quality Engineer for a company in Northern Virginia. <br>
